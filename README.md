# PROJECT Build basic Todo React

## Build a very basic Todo List in React. Managing state in local storage.

---

Start a new React Project `npx create-react-app [MyAppName]`

`npm start` — Starts the development server.

`npm run build` — Bundles the app into static files for production.

`npm test` — Starts the test runner.

`npm run eject` — Removes this tool and copies build dependencies, configuration files
and scripts into the app directory. If you do this, you can’t go back!

We suggest that you begin by typing:`cd todo-list-in-react` → `npm start`
